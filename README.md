PIUIO Board Clone
===========

This is an clone of the original Pump It Up USB IO Board. It's fully compatible with the original one.
This uses V-USB Library for an emulated USB interface at ATMEGA328. Other devices may be compatible too.

TODO: Publish the clone board schematic.

PS: The V-USB folder (a.k.a. usbdrv) is intact and original. Keeping the licenses of it. It is not my property.
